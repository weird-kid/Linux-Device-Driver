1. So, the first error was because he didn't use a function prototype can called a function before it was actually declared.
    Okay I think I understood something new
    So, if you call a function before its declaration it assumes it returns a int value and guess parameter data types based on called function
    , and then we it's not a int value, C compiler is confused and 
    returns "conflicting type" error 
    !
