This is a Scull Driver.

This means the memory of Kernel is abstracted as a External Hardware Device.
The purpose of this driver, is to learn to implement Scull_read() and Scull_write() functions. To read memory data and write
onto it as thought it was a external device like a keyboard/mouse.

This program is supposed to run in Kernel mode.
